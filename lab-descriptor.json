The primary need for virtualisation here is multifold.<br/><br/>1.Digital Logic and Computer Organization are core courses in most of the Undergraduate Curricula of the entire Electrical Sciences Discipline(Computer Science / Engg., Electronics, Electrical) etc. <br/><br/>2. Many colleges/institutes cannot procure sufficient number of FPGA boards for their students.</br></br>Even when such FPGA boards are available, making them available round the clock is difficult.<br/><br/>4. Expert help is required to effectively use these FPGA boards and such help can be easily channeled through a virtual environment.<br/><br/>5. Helps to standardize the set of Experiments to a large extent.",
